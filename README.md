	#Project Tic Tac Toe
This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum, specifically the javascript path. The aim of this project is to demonstrate my ability to use factory functions and modules to make a browser tic tac toe game. This will require some basic use of html, css, and extensive use of javascript.
